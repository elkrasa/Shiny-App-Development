# Shiny-App-Development
You can find my app on Shiny server:
https://elkrasa.shinyapps.io/weightloosingapp/
I wrote this simple app to keep track of my body volumes while I'm loosing weight.
Every 2 months I do volume measurments in cm of different parameters of my body (waist, breast, hips, arm, etc.)
and write data to the speadsheet "Measurments.xlsx". The data is being taken from the spreadsheet and plotted to 
the "Volume loosing diagramm". There are sliders for the diagramm that aloud to choose particular period of time to see the progress. 
Looking at this diagramm i can keep track of body my fat loosing and making sure all my parameters have improved 
and in positive dynamic. It's not much data there yet, but after a year it will be interesting to see what progress i had.
